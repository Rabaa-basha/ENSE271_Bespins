## Summarized project background & business need/opportunity

IABC Regina is one of many other IABC companies all over the world. Their business concentrates on communications, connecting members of the company together for broader experience and sharing knowledge.

While their website is crucial for their business, it is has some problems:

    + Not maintainable "complex back-end".
    + Unresponsive / not engaging design.
    + Lack of payment methods.

A list was created that might mitigate their functional needs accordingly:

    + Ability to accept online payments.
    + Displaying "Advertising" job postings.
    + Maintainable back-end.

Some non-functional opportunities have been planned to as well

    + Effective navigation.
    + Decent simple design.
    + Economical build and functioning.
    + Searchable "SEO".
    + Responsive "Quick response"

## Northstar
    + IABC Regina Members.
## Carryover customers 
    + Non-member users.
    + Job applicants.

## Assumptions
    + Project will be developed using WordPress.
    + Testing the website's design will take most of our time resources.
    + We will get more specific comments on the project and better questions to ask after each meeting with the IABC.
## Constraints
    + Limited meetings with the clients.
    + Limited cost "9k CDN" provided by the IABC.
    + Not enough information about the visitors of the website.
